A fun and powerful guide to using emojis in Salesforce Apex logs — because debugging should be smart and stylish. 💡🚀🧠

# 🧠 Developer Debug Logs — with Emojis!

> A fun and meaningful way to spice up your `System.debug()` logs in Salesforce Apex.

---

## 💡 Why Emojis?

Emojis help highlight the **intent and context** of log messages instantly. Whether it's a recursion warning or a successful record insert, an emoji grabs attention faster than plain text.

---

## 🚀 How to Use

Just copy and paste the emoji character directly into your `System.debug()` message.

✅ Valid:
```apex
System.debug('📦 Inserted 200 records successfully!');
```

❌ Invalid:
```apex
System.debug(U+1F4E6); // Won’t compile in Apex
```
